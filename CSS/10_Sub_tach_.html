    <h1 class="subrayado">You're Gonna Go Far, Kid</h1>
    <p>
        Show me how to lie, <span class="subrayado">you're getting better all the time</span><br>
        And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach<br>
        Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd<br>
        And as you step back into line a mob jumps to their feet<br><br>

        Now <span class="tachado">dance, fucker, dance</span>, man, he never had a chance<br>
        And no one even knew it was really only you<br><br>

        And now you steal away<br>
        Take him out today<br>
        <span class="subrayado">Nice work you did</span><br>
        You're gonna go far, kid<br><br>

        With <span class="tachado">a thousand lies and a good disguise</span><br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        When you walk away nothing more to say<br>
        <span class="subrayado">See the lightning in your eyes</span><br>
        See 'em running for their lives<br><br>

        Slowly out of line and drifting closer in your sights<br>
        So play it out, I'm wide awake, it's a scene about me<br>
        There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay<br>
        And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me<br><br>

        Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance<br>
        And no one even knew it was really only you<br><br>

        And now you'll lead the way<br>
        Show the light of day<br>
        <span class="tachado">Nice work you did</span><br>
        You're gonna go far, kid<br><br>

        With a thousand lies and a good disguise<br>
        <span class="tachado">Hit 'em right between the eyes</span><br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        When you walk away nothing more to say<br>
        See the lightning in your eyes<br>
        See 'em running for their lives<br><br>

        Now dance, fucker, dance, he never had a chance<br>
        And no one even knew it was really only you<br>
        So dance, fucker, dance, I never had a chance<br>
        It was really only you<br><br>

        With a thousand lies and a good disguise<br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        When you walk away nothing more to say<br>
        <span class="subrayado">See the lightning in your eyes</span><br>
        See 'em running for their lives<br><br>

        Clever alibis, lord of the flies<br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        Hit 'em right between the eyes<br>
        When you walk away nothing more to say<br>
        <span class="subrayado">See the lightning in your eyes</span><br>
        See 'em running for their lives
