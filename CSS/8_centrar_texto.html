    <p>I walk a lonely avenue
        I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
        Meet a girl like you
        With auburn hair and tawny eyes
        The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
        Hypnotize me through.</p>
    <p>And I ran, I ran so far away
        I just ran, I ran all night and day
        I couldn't get away
    </p>
    <p>A cloud appears above your head
        A beam of light comes shining down on you
        Shining down on you
        The cloud is moving nearer still
        Aurora borealis comes in view
        Aurora comes in view</p>
    <p>And I ran, I ran so far away
        I just ran, I ran all night and day
        I couldn't get away</p>
    <p>Reached out a hand to touch your face
        You're slowly disappearing from my view
        'Pearing from my view
        Reached out a hand to try again
        I'm floating in a beam of light with you
        A beam of light with you</p>
    <p>And I ran, I ran so far away
        I just ran, I ran all night and day
        And I ran, I ran so far away
        I just ran, I couldn't get away</p>
