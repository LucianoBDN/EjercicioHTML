    <h1>We Are the Danger XL</h1>
    <p>Bright city light
        Another night to die
        And I'm feeling so high
        All these days are passing by
        I question myself why
        I'm feeling this burned out
        I fear the day I throw away
        Any chance to take this all the way
        Needless to say, we'll see how it turns out
        <hr>
        Everybody get down!
        Light 'em up
        We are the danger
        And we looking to score
        Everybody get down!
        Light 'em up
        We are the danger
        And now we're looking for more
        Everybody get down!
        <hr>
        Heading out for good
        Quicker than I should
        No I wouldn't change it if I could
        Don't say you never would
        We've seen how this plays out
        We've held it down, brought it to the ground
        In the dust and ashes, we've been found
        It's in our hands now
        Let's hope we can hold out</p>
